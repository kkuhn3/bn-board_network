# bn-board_network

A turn based take on the Megaman Battle Network games. 

## Description

Runs in HTML/JS, allows creation of user folders, and has the ability to be matched up with someone else hitting the same website. Some mechanics are inspired by Battlecon and Pokemon Showdown. I have plans to refactor almost all of this code... eventually.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Jquery 3.3.1 - I want to remove this in a future refactor
* BootStrap 3.4.0

### Installing

```
cd path/to/websocket
composer install
```

### Executing program

* Open index.html in a web browser
